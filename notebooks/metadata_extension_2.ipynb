    "# Extension Processing and Categorization in WDI Indicator Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to process and categorize the **extensions** found in the WDI (World Development Indicators) dataset. Extensions provide additional details such as **gender, demographic groups, education level, and geographic location**. By extracting and structuring these extensions into separate columns ( or jsut one column), we aim to enhance the hierarchical organization of the data for better analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered when analysing the data \n",
    "1. **Missing Extensions**: Some indicators in the WDI dataset lack extensions, making it difficult to determine additional attributes for certain data points.  \n",
    "2. **Ambiguous Extensions**: Certain extensions, such as **\"FE\"**, do not always correspond to a single category (e.g., \"FE\" may indicate **Female** in some cases but represent something else in other contexts). This requires additional context or mapping strategies to ensure accurate classification.  \n",
