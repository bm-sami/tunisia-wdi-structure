    "\n",
    "## Key Columns \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code**: A unique identifier for each indicator, consisting of structured abbreviations representing different aspects of the indicator. This column will be used to merge metadata with the main dataset and extract hierarchical information.\n",
    "- **Indicator Name**: The full descriptive name of the indicator, providing additional context beyond the code.\n",
    "- **Short Definition**: A concise summary of what the indicator measures, useful for quick reference.\n",
    "- **Long Definition**: A more detailed explanation of the indicator, including its significance, calculation method, and relevance to policy or research.\n",
    "- **Topic**: The broad category under which the indicator falls (e.g., Education, Health, Economy). This helps in organizing and classifying the data.\n",
    "- **Unit of Measure**: Specifies how the indicator values are represented (e.g., percentage, absolute number, GDP in USD).\n",
    "- **Periodicity**: Indicates how frequently the data is collected or updated (e.g., annual, quarterly, monthly).\n",
    "- **Source**: The organization or institution that provides the data, ensuring traceability and reliability.\n",
    "- **Aggregation Method**: Describes how the indicator values are aggregated across different regions or time periods (e.g., average, sum, weighted mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supporting Columns for Contextual Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Period**: A reference point used for calculations in some indicators (e.g., base year for GDP deflation).\n",
    "- **Reference Period**: Specifies the time frame to which the indicator values apply, sometimes aligning with periodicity.\n",
    "- **Development Relevance**: Explains the significance of the indicator in global development efforts, such as how it aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
    "- **Limitations and Exceptions**: Notes any constraints or special considerations regarding the indicator's data quality, coverage, or interpretation.\n",
    "- **General Comments**: Additional notes or clarifications about the indicator.\n",
    "- **Other Notes**: Miscellaneous information that may provide further insights.\n",
    "- **Notes from Original Source**: Any remarks or annotations from the data provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplementary Columns for External References\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Related Indicators**: Lists other indicators that are conceptually or methodologically linked, useful for comparative analysis.\n",
    "- **Related Source Links**: Provides links to additional resources or datasets related to the indicator.\n",
    "- **Other Web Links**: Includes external references that might offer more context but are not essential for analysis."

    "## Extracting Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The indicator codes follow a structured format where each segment represents a specific attribute. For example, the indicator **SE.SEC.TCAQ.LO.MA.ZS** can be broken down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SE** → **Sector: Education**  \n",
    "- **SEC** → **Secondary education level**  \n",
    "- **TCAQ** → **Completion rate (Total Completion Adjustment Quintile)**  \n",
    "- **LO** → **Lower secondary**  \n",
    "- **MA** → **Male**  \n",
    "- **ZS** → **Percentage (% of total students)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means the indicator represents the **completion rate in lower secondary education for males, expressed as a percentage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting Hierarchy from General Topic:\n",
    "To determine the hierarchy, we will extract information from the **General Topic** column, which follows a structured format like **XX:XX:XX**. In this structure:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part represents the **Topic**  \n",
    "- The second part represents the **SubTopic1**  \n",
    "- The third part represents the **SubTopic2** (if available)  \n",
    "\n",
    "By parsing this structure, we can derive meaningful categorizations from the **General Topic** directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilizing WDI Documentation:\n",
    "In addition to extracting hierarchy from the General Topic, we will also utilize **WDI documentation** to validate, refine, and complete missing values. This will allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract hierarchy from General Topic** by splitting it into structured categories.  \n",
    "2. **Compare with the WDI documentation** to verify the classification.  \n",
    "3. **Fill missing values** in the extracted hierarchy using official WDI descriptions.  \n",
    "4. **Ensure consistency and accuracy** by cross-referencing extracted data with predefined classifications in the metadata.  \n",
    "5. **Refine category mappings** to align with meaningful classifications for analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures a structured and systematic classification of indicators while handling inconsistencies or missing classifications effectively.\n"

    "`Main Category : Specific Topic :  Specific Topic2`\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- **SG.VAW.REFU.ZS** → `Gender: Health`\n",

    "### **Grouping Strategy**\n",
    "Using this structure, we can extract:\n",
    "1. **Main Category** (before `:`) → Helps in broad classification.\n",
    "2. **Subcategory/Specification** (after `:`) → Provides finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "- Apply a script to **split** the indicator names into `Main Category` and `Subcategory`.\n",
    "- Focus on the WDI data to extract hierarchy and also look into the the `Main Category` and `Subcategory` if there are missing data or for comparison reasons. \n",
    "- Use these categories to **group the data** and create structured reports.\n"

    "## Next Steps: Extracting Embedded Information for Enhanced Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To further refine our analysis, we can extract additional key information that is not explicitly stated in the general topics but is **embedded within the code structure itself**. This approach will allow us to derive **hidden attributes** such as gender, geographic classifications, and other contextual details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Deriving Gender Information from Codes**\n",
    "- Certain indicators implicitly contain gender-specific details within their **codes or naming conventions** (e.g., \"F\" for female, \"M\" for male, \"MF\" for both).\n",
    "- We can develop a **code-mapping system** to automatically flag indicators as gender-related by parsing these patterns.\n",
    "- Once identified, we can create a **Gender Attribute** column to categorize each indicator as:\n",
    "  - **Male-Specific**\n",
    "  - **Female-Specific**\n",
    "  - **Gender-Neutral**\n",
    "  - **Gender Ratio or Comparison (Male vs. Female)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Extracting Geographic Classifications from Codes**\n",
    "- Many datasets (especially from sources like the **World Bank**) encode **geographical details** (e.g., country, region, rural vs. urban classification) directly into the indicator codes.\n",
    "- We can define **predefined mappings** to extract and classify these indicators into:\n",
    "  - **Urban vs. Rural Distinction** (when available)\n",
    "- This extracted classification can be used for targeted comparisons and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Inferring Socioeconomic Groupings**\n",
    "- Some indicators include classifications related to **income levels, employment status, or education tiers** that are embedded in their codes.\n",
    "- By analyzing recurring patterns in these codes, we can derive additional attributes such as:\n",
    "  - **Low-Income vs. High-Income Population**\n",
    "  - **Employment Sector (e.g., Formal vs. Informal Employment)**\n",
    "  - **Educational Attainment (e.g., Primary, Secondary, Tertiary Education)**\n",
    "- These inferred attributes would allow us to conduct **equity-based analysis** across socioeconomic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Age Group Classification from Codes**\n",
    "- Many demographic and health indicators categorize data by **age brackets** but may not explicitly mention them in topics.\n",
    "- We can extract these **age-specific classifications** from the codes and categorize them into:\n",
    "  - **Children (0-14 years)**\n",
    "  - **Youth (15-24 years)**\n",
    "  - **Working Age (25-64 years)**\n",
    "  - **Elderly (65+ years)**\n",
    "- This approach would improve age-based analytical insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This all can be done by annlising the documentation and looking for specific parts of code that can add other informations**\n"
