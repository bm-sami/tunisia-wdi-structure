# Tunisia-WDI  
A dataset extracted from the **World Bank** World Development Indicators (WDI) database. In this project, I focused on data related to Tunisia. This project emphasizes **categorizing and organizing** the metadata and the actual data to facilitate further analysis and dashboard creation.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to **structure and group indicators** from the **World Bank WDI dataset** into meaningful categories based on metadata information. The project starts by working on the **Topic** column to extract related subtopics. After this, I worked on **filling missing subtopics** using indicator codes and extended the metadata to create further divisions (e.g., **gender** and **geography**). This structured dataset will later serve as a foundation for developing an interactive dashboard.  

## Project Structure  
1. **Topic**:  
   The project begins by organizing the metadata to categorize indicators into **Topics** and **Subtopics**.  
   - The **Topic** column is processed to extract the corresponding **Subtopics**.  
   

2. **Code**:  
   Missing subtopics are filled based on the indicator codes to ensure completeness.

3. **Extensions**:  
   The next step involves working with the **extensions**, which categorize the indicators further by **Gender** or **Geography**. For example, gender-related indicators can be found as **Male** and **Female**.

## Next Steps  
**Enhancing metadata organization:**  
   - Further refining **category mapping**  

**Data Processing & Integration:**  
   - Structuring the final dataset for visualization and dashboard integration  

**Dashboard Development:**  
   - Creating an **interactive visualization** to explore Tunisia's economic and social indicators  

## Data Sources  
- **World Bank Data:** [World Bank Data (World Development Indicators)](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)  
- **WDI Indicator Data:** [WDI Database](https://www.worldbank.org/en/archive/using-the-archives/using-our-finding-aids/API-Access-to-Archival-Description-Metadata)  

## About The Data  
World Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional, and global estimates.  
[Note: Even though Global Development Finance (GDF) is no longer listed in the WDI database name, all external debt and financial flows data continue to be included in WDI.]
